# Ethical Use Guidelines

## What This Is For

This is a **learning project** to explore:
- Browser automation techniques
- AI integration patterns
- Chrome DevTools Protocol
- TypeScript architecture

## What This Is NOT For

❌ Cheating on real tests or assignments  
❌ Violating terms of service  
❌ Circumventing security  
❌ Academic dishonesty

## Consequences

Using automation on real assessments can lead to:

**Academic:**
- Failing grades
- Expulsion
- Degree revocation
- Loss of scholarships

**Legal:**
- Computer fraud charges (CFAA, Computer Misuse Act)
- Fines and criminal penalties

**Platform:**
- Account bans
- Terms of service violations
- Legal action

**Personal:**
- You won't learn what you need
- Unfair to other students
- Devalues your credentials

## Legitimate Uses

✅ Learning about browser automation  
✅ Understanding AI integration  
✅ Building accessibility tools  
✅ Testing your own quiz software  
✅ Research on automation detection  
✅ With explicit permission from instructors

## If You're Struggling

Don't cheat. Instead:
- Talk to your professor
- Use tutoring services
- Form study groups
- Ask for extensions
- Drop and retake the course

These won't ruin your future. Cheating will.

## For Educators

This tool shows why online assessment security matters. It's detectable with:
- Proctoring software
- Timing analysis
- Randomized questions/answers
- Open-ended questions

Use this as a discussion starter about academic integrity.

## Bottom Line

This is for learning about automation, not for cheating. If you're unsure whether your use is appropriate, don't do it.

By using this code, you accept full responsibility for legal and ethical use.
